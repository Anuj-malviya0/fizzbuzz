Basic solution of classic problem 

 <hr /> 
## fibonacci_series
The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it:

the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1),
the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
the 5 is (2+3),
and so on!
So we can write the rule:

The Rule is xn = xn−1 + xn−2

where:

xn is term number "n"
xn−1 is the previous term (n−1)
xn−2 is the term before that (n−2)

The script creates sequence up to n provided inside the function

## fizzbuzz
Suppose we have a number n. We have to display a string representation of all numbers from 1 to n, but there are some constraints.

If the number is divisible by 3, write Fizz instead of the number

If the number is divisible by 5, write Buzz instead of the number

If the number is divisible by 3 and 5 both, write FizzBuzz instead of the number
