## fibonacci_series
The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it:

the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1),
the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
the 5 is (2+3),
and so on!
So we can write the rule:

The Rule is xn = xn−1 + xn−2

where:

xn is term number "n"
xn−1 is the previous term (n−1)
xn−2 is the term before that (n−2)

The script creates sequence up to n provided inside the function
